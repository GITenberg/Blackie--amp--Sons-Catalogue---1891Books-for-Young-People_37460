<p class="hang">
<b>St. Bartholomew's Eve</b>: A Tale of the Huguenot Wars. By <span class="sc">G.
A. Henty</span>. With 12 page Illustrations by <span class="sc">H. J. Draper</span>,
and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6<i>s.</i>
</p>

<p class="blurb">
The title of this story takes you at once to its subject. The
hero, Philip Fletcher, is a right true English lad, but he has a
French connection on the mother's side. This kinship induces him
to cross the Channel in order to take a share in that splendid
struggle for freedom known as the Huguenot wars. Naturally he
sides with the Protestants, distinguishes himself in various
battles, and receives rapid promotion for the zeal and daring with
which he carries out several secret missions. At length, however,
he is entrapped in Paris, with other prominent Huguenots, on that
terrible St. Bartholomew's Eve, when the tocsin gave the signal
at midnight for the massacre to begin. It is an enthralling
narrative, and the chapter which deals with the escape of the hero
out of that monstrous city is one of the most thrilling in a story
which is full of interest.

<p class="hang">
<b>Through the Sikh War</b>: A Tale of the Conquest of the
Punjaub. By <span class="sc">G. A. Henty</span>. With 12 page Illustrations by <span class="sc">Hal
Hurst</span>, and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6<i>s.</i>
</p>

<p class="blurb">
This story gives a vivid picture of the pluck and obstinacy with
which the British maintained their ascendency in India. Percy
Groves, a spirited English lad, leaves school to join his uncle in
the Punjaub, where he is governor of a district under the native
Sikh prince, Runjeet Singh. The natives are in a state of revolt,
and Percy takes an active part in all the troubles which precede
the Sikh war. His uncle's fortress is beleaguered, and he assists
in repelling the attack. Then when the authorities at Lahore
proclaim war Percy joins the British force as a volunteer, and
takes a distinguished share in the famous battles of Moodkee,
Sobraon, and Chillianwalla. Apart from its high interest as a
record of personal daring, this story shows in dashing style how
Englishmen have made an Empire.

</p>

<p class="blurb">
"We are not aware that any one has given us quite so vigorous a
picture of Britain in the days of the Roman conquest. Mr. Henty
has done his utmost to make an impressive picture of the haughty
Roman character, with its indomitable courage, sternness, and
discipline. <i>Beric</i> is good all through."&#8212;<i>Spectator.</i>

</p>

<p class="blurb">
"There are adventures of all kinds for the hero and his friends,
whose pluck and ingenuity in extricating themselves from awkward
fixes are always equal to the occasion. It is an excellent story,
and if the proportion of history is smaller than usual, the whole
result leaves nothing to be desired."&#8212;<i>Journal of

Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6<i>s.</i>
</p>

<p class="blurb">
"It has a good plot; it abounds in action; the scenes are equally
spirited and realistic, and we can only say we have read it with
much pleasure from first to last. The pictures of life on a cattle
ranche are most graphically painted, as are the manners of the
reckless but jovial cow-boys."&#8212;<i>Times.</i>

"The Dash for Khartoum is your ideal boys' book."&#8212;<i>Tablet.</i>
</p>

<p class="blurb">

the incidents which fall to be recorded after the dash for
Khartoum has been made and failed are quite as interesting as
those which precede it."&#8212;<i>Academy.</i>

<p class="blurb">
"The story is a capital one and full of variety, and presents us
with many picturesque scenes of Southern life. Young Wingfield,

been a man after the very heart of Stonewall
Jackson."&#8212;<i>Times.</i>

"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of <i>Quentin
Durward.</i> The lad's journey across France with his faithful
attendant Malcolm, and his hairbreadth escapes from the

of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness of treatment and

"The effect of an interesting story, well constructed and vividly

<b>A Jacobite Exile</b>: Being the Adventures of a Young Englishman

8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 5<i>s.</i>
</p>

<p class="blurb">
In this story Sir Marmaduke Carstairs, who is a Jacobite, is
denounced as a plotter against the life of King William, and
although innocent of the charge, he has to flee from England. His
son Charlie, who goes with him to Sweden, is the hero of the tale.
This youth joins the foreign legion under Charles XII. of Sweden,
and takes a distinguished part in several famous campaigns against
the Russians and the Poles. Besides his stirring career as a
soldier, the narrative is full of the hero's personal adventures
in Poland, Sweden, Russia, and England. The narrative swings along
at a breathless pace, and holds the reader entranced to the end.

<p class="blurb">
"The best of this year's Henty. His narrative is more interesting
than many of the tales with which the public is familiar, of
escape from Siberia. Despite their superior claim to authenticity
these tales are without doubt no less fictitious than Mr. Henty's,
and he beats them hollow in the matter of sensations. The escape
of the hero and his faithful Tartar from the Samoyedes is quite
the high-water mark of this author's achievement."&#8212;<i>National

This is the story of a great fortune, and its attendant train of
misfortunes. The Folletts are a middle-class family who suddenly
find themselves in the possession of immense wealth, and the
interest is obtained by showing what effect this change has upon
their various characters. With fine subtlety the author depicts
the schemes, duplicities, worries, and disappointments which
follow the Folletts in their efforts to scramble into society and
make aristocratic marriages. Then, in the midst of their plans,
the wealth is taken from them, and the friendships which they have
made are shown in their true character. Altogether it is a bright,
clever, entertaining tale, with a rare distinction in its minute
portrayal of diverse character.

<p class="blurb">
In this story the interest is mainly secured by a description of
life on the wild North Sea,&#8212;the hero being a parson's son who is
apprenticed on board a Lowestoft fishing lugger. The lad has to
suffer many buffets from his shipmates, while the storms and
dangers which he braved on board the "North Star" are set forth
with minute knowledge and intense power. The wreck of "The Golden
Fleece" forms the climax to a thrilling series of desperate
mischances. From this point the narrative deals with a mysterious
highway robbery and murder; the trial of the accused fisherman;
his escape, and the mad chase after the criminal out upon the high
seas. Altogether, this is a wholesome tale with plenty of
sea-water in it, and a fine run of breezy adventure.

governess, and it is then that she begins to learn her own strange
history. It is a tale of surprising vicissitude, which is slowly
unravelled with happy skill, but in the end all the wrongs are
pleasantly righted. The interest of this narrative never for a
moment flags, because the character of the heroine is as
fascinating as the mystery of her birth.

<p class="blurb">
This story deals with the Conquest of Mexico by Cortes and his
Spaniards. They are the daring white conquerors who pushed their
way through countless difficulties into the great Aztec kingdom,
and established their power in the wondrous city where Montezuma
reigned in barbaric splendour. This episode is one of the most
romantic in all history, and the author of this narrative has made
it newly entrancing by the many cunning effects which he has added
with consummate dexterity. It were simply vain to single out any
particular adventure in a narrative which teems with happenings of
the weirdest kind.

Philip Trevellon was an English lad who thought to become a Lord
High Admiral like his hero, Horatio Nelson. By way of achieving
this purpose he ran away from home and joined a privateer. After
taking part in the capture of a French frigate, he was captured by
Corsairs and sold into slavery. He escaped, and his subsequent
bravery in a sea fight brought him an interview with Lord Nelson,
and promotion. Having been appointed to the <i>Victory</i> he took
part in the battle of Trafalgar. This is a real saltwater story,
set forth in a hearty, handsome, old-fashioned style.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
